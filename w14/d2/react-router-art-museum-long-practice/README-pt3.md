# Phase 3: `Switch`

Here's a breakdown of the steps you'll be taking in this phase (more detailed
instruction below):

1. Create `<Route>` in __App.js__ for the home page.
2. Create `<Route>` in __App.js__ for 404 errors/unknown paths.

Make two more routes in the `App` component:

**(1)** One for the home page at `/` and

**(2)** One for "Page Not Found" 404 errors.

The home page should display a `<h2>` with the text "Harvard Art Museum" and a
description (`<p>`) with the text "Look, but Don't Touch. Please select a
Gallery in the navigation bar."

And one more for route for displaying an `<h2>` "Page Not Found" when none of
the routes in `App` matches the current path. To make the final "Page Not Found"
route, you will need to utilize React Router's `Switch` component. [Nice to have
some decent documentation, isn't it?][switch]

Test this out by navigating to a route like `/not-found`. You should see "Page
Not Found" and not "Harvard Art Museum". At `/galleries/:galleryId`, you should
see the name of the gallery and not "Harvard Art Museum".
